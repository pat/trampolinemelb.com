        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        
        <p>While we like to keep Trampoline as free-flowing and dynamic as possible, we do have some guidelines (influenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Philosophy">the Open Space philosophy</a>) which we feel help drive the event to be a success.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The Law of Two Feet</li>
          <li>If it&#8217;s to be, it&#8217;s up to me.</li>
          <li><em>Some</em> knowledge helps</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Law of Two Feet</h3>
        
        <p>At Trampoline, you can go anywhere you like, at any time. More importantly, don&#8217;t feel you've committed to a specific session once you sit down there. If you&#8217;re neither learning or contributing, you are encouraged to use your two feet and visit the other sessions.</p>
        
        <h3>If it&#8217;s to be, it&#8217;s up to me</h3>
        
        <p>Trampoline is not about achieving great things, nor determining future actions. The event is simply a place and time, where you can meet, share and discuss ideas. Because of this, sessions should not be used as a pitch for action.</p>
        
        <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t want to see great things happen, but <strong>you</strong> need to be the driving force, not us. Please feel welcome to draw people together to discuss a project, and you can use some of the spaces in DonkeyWheel House for this on the day &mdash; just not in the session rooms.</p>
        
        <h3><em>Some</em> knowledge helps</h3>
        
        <p>You do not need to be an expert to speak at Trampoline, but some knowledge helps. Please don&#8217;t be afraid to speak &mdash; indeed, we encourage you to! &mdash; but it helps to have at least a little knowledge about your topic.</p>
