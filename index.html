        <h2>Starting Time</h2>
        
        <p>It seems some technical difficulties stopped a final email reaching some people, so just to clarify: Trampoline starts this morning at 9:30 sharp - we recommend you aim to arrive at 9am.</p>
        
        <p>Sorry for any last minute confusion!</p>
        
        <h2>What?</h2>
        
        <p>Borrowing from the concepts around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamps</a> and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconferences</a>, <strong>Trampoline</strong> is an informal day of sharing ideas in <strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>. The first occurance happened on the 28<span class="ordinal">th</span> of March, 2009. By popular demand, there is another one coming up on October 24<span class="ordinal">th</span> &mdash; although places are already booked out! (We weren't expecting such a rush.)

        <p>The goal is to cover subjects that will be appealing across different disciplines. Technical or business-focused, environmental or social, new or old, complex or simple&#8212;as long as the ideas are interesting and you find them amazing, they&#8217;ll fit right in.</p>

        <p>Trampoline is a self-organising event for those who find the world interesting, have something to offer and share, and have an inquisitive mind. All attendees are expected to come along with <strong>participation</strong> in mind&#8212;the discussions (sessions is a bit too formal, lectures even more so) are suggested and scheduled at the start of the day.</p>
        
        <p>Some examples from the first event:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pieter Peach</strong> bounced around some ideas on the future of health</li>
          <li><strong>Caroline Tunnell-Jones</strong> explained the finer points of wine tasting</li>
          <li><strong>Dan Walmsley</strong> demonstrated the parallels between improvisational comedy and entrepreneurship</li>
          <li><strong>Emily Freeman</strong> led a discussion about the future of business information with regards to mass collaboration, free information and the semantic web</li>
          <li><strong>Sam Sabey</strong> pondered energy efficiency and a distributed community energy future</li>
          <li><strong>Keith De La Rue</strong> discussed how complexity and chaos can be dealt with using the Cynefin model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where?</h2>
        
        <p>Trampoline will again be happening at the fantastic Donkey Wheel, at 673 Bourke St in Melbourne's CBD.</p>
        
        <h2>How?</h2>
        
        <p>We'll be announcing the date and opening up (free) reservations for the next Trampoline sometime in the next month. To hear the news first, sign up on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/trampoline-melb">the group discussion email list</a>.</p>
        
        <p>For those of you who will be there, what you need to do is show up on the day, and suggest topics to discuss. Anything is fair game. We&#8217;ll have some structures set out closer to the event, but in the meantime, <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2006/how-to-run-a-great-unconference-session/">Scott Berkun has some great suggestions</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        
        <p>Because we love inspiring, absorbing conversations, and we love big concepts that make us think differently about the world. We think you might too.</p>
